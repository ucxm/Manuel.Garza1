	<p> Canopy is a program that we used to create many games like guesse game, hangman, and lucky sevens.All these games work by just some line code. It may look easy but trust me it is not. Here is a link to download canopy and try it for yourself.<a href="https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/">Enthought Canopy </a></p>
